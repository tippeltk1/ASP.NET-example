<h2>What is our Mission?</h2>
<p>
    We originally set out on a mission to create the best wizarding wares we possibly could for Wizards and Witches of all shapes and sizes!
</p>
<p>
    Once we got going, we quickly noticed a lack of availability in all areas of the wizarding world, so we added wands, books, and potions to our store, and we plan to continue expanding to provide the best wares, tools, and resources for all!
</p>
<h2>What is our history?</h2>
<p>
    In 1654, our own Cicero opened up a small wizard hat store in Diagon Alley that centered around his custom lineup of unique wizarding hats, most notably creating sorting hats similar to the Hogwards sorting hats for houses in other Wizarding schools.
    <br><br>
    In 1665, when a large group of Dark Wizards were ramping up their creation of more Dark Arts magic (know in the Muggle world as the Great Plague of London), a spell that caused death to spread due to contaminated clothing became widely feared. It was as this time that Cicero began mass-producing and selling many types of clothes for all needs. After the Dark Wizards were caught, Cicero's clothes continued to rise in popularity, with many people noticing both the unique style, and comfort of the custom-made clothes.
    <br><br>
    After he passed in 1747, we have strived to continue Cicero's work, expanding the availability and options of the store. Most recently, we have added rats of all breeds to the collection of pets for wizards and witches.
