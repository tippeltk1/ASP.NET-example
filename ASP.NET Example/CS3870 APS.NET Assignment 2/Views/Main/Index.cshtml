        I absolutely loved what they had at Cicero's! I was able to find the perfect spooky cloak to scare my friends, at a price I could afford too! I will recommend this to all my friends! - Luna Lovegood

        For the life of me, I could not find any 5-XL robe sizes! Hogwarts wasn't going to allow me to teach this year, but thankfully I was able to finally find clothes at Cicero's! - Rubeus Hagrid
